# DOBOT robotic arm manipulation using interface and image processing

In the development of this project, the
DOBOT robotic arm is implemented to position 3 cubes
of different colors, for which a GUI interface is created
through Python 2.5 and the recognition of the colors of
the cubes is carried out using digital image processing
with Python 3.0. This report presents: the assembly
carried out in the project, the programming logic used,
a brief introduction about the configuration and
manipulation framework of the DOBOT robotic arm
and the results of the implementation.
